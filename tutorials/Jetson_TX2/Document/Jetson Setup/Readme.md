## Install basic dependencies
Installing all the necessary dependencies that will help your code compile

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

## Install Ros


Choose the suitable version of ROS on the TX2: 
	+ Kinetic for Ubuntu 16.04
	+ Melodic for Ubuntu 18.04
and install following the instruction on the ROS official wiki: wiki.ros.org/<distro>/installation/Ubuntu
   *Note: During the installation process, errors may occured. This part will cover some possible ones.
	When using the command $sudo apt install ros-<distro>-desktop-full, get error:
```
	  E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open(11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
	  E: Unable to aquire the dpkg frontend lock
```
	
This is due another process getting stuck or currently running
=> Solution: 
Check running processes containing "apt" with: 
	```$ps aux | grep [a]pt```
Wait a bit and check again if the process is still running or not. 
It could just be running and not stuck!
If the process is stuck, try killing it with 		
	```$sudo kill -9 <process_id>``` 
(The process ID is the first number on the output)
## Setup the catkin workspace: 
Use the following commands to create
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
```
To compile the workspace, we should source the ROS environment to get access to ROS functions
```
    $ source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash
```
Initialize a new catkin workspace
```
    $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    $ catkin_init_workspace
```
Build the workspace
```
    $ cd ~/catkin_ws
    $ catkin_make
```
*Note: catkin_ws can be any workspace name you want
Source the new setup.*sh file
```		
    $ source devel/setup.bash
```
To source the setup.*sh file everytime we start a new bash session, we use 
```
    $ echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    $ source ~/.bashrc
```	
To ensure the workspace i properly overlayed by the setup script
```		
    $echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH /home/<user_name>/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/<distro>/share
```	  
this should return the same path

## Orbbec Astra
Orbbec Astra is the package that handle the connection between the device and the Orbbec Camera. You can follow the official installation guide [here](https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_camera)

## RTIMULib2
RTIMULib2 is the library that helps you calibrate and acquire data from the IMU sensor mounted on Jetson TX2. 

```bash
sudo ./rtimulib2.sh
```
## DiRa APIs
DiRa project also provide you with the necessary packages to help you control the rover better:

hal: provide the node to control the proximity sensor at the front of the car, as well as the LCD screen and the four buttons plus a led indicator

car_control: provide the node to control the car's speed and steering angle through the ESC

mpu_9250: provide the node to acquire data from the IMU sensor

```bash
svn checkout https://github.com/fpt-corp/DriverlessCar_DR_ROS/trunk/core

sudo cp -a core/* ~/catkin_ws/src/

cd ~/catkin_ws/

catkin_make

cd ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/car_controller/

sudo chown root:root car_controller_node
sudo chmod a+rx car_controller_node
sudo chmod u+s car_controller_node


cd ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/hal/

sudo chown root:root hal_node
sudo chmod a+rx hal_node
sudo chmod u+s hal_node


cd ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/mpu_9250/

sudo chown root:root mpu_9250_node
sudo chmod a+rx mpu_9250_node
sudo chmod u+s mpu_9250_node

```
## Fixing uninstalled dependencies
Assuming you missed some steps along the process of flashing and is missing some important dependencies that was not included in the setup.sh script, it is advised that you open the Jetpack program on your host again, put your Jetson into recovery mode, connect it to your host and install the necessary dependencies by selecting them from the Jetpack UI. If, for some reason, you are unable to do so, please refer to the [Cuda installation instruction](https://github.com/fpt-corp/DiRa/blob/master/DiRa_Software/Jetson_TX2/Document/Jetson%20Setup/Cuda%20Installation%20on%20Jetson) we provided here.
