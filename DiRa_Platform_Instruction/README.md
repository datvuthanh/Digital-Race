# DiRa car Platform Instructions


The documents contained in this repository provide all of the information required to construct and operate a complete DiRa car platform. The platform has two primary parts, the chassis(Traxxas car) and compute box(Jetson TX2 Dev Board).

## Getting Started

Look though the documentation and [Download](https://github.com/fpt-corp/DiRa/tree/master/DiRa_Digital_Race_Software/Jetson_TX2/Image_Build) our latest release. Look over the Getting Started section in the chassis and compute box instruction documents, followed by the parts list and the operating procedures to get a sense of the build process, skill requirements, fabrication methods, and testing procedures. The DiRa car platform can be fabricated by a small team (3 - 5 students) of non-professionals. The build will go most smoothly if there is at least one person on the team familiar with basic soldering, 3D printing, Ubuntu and ROS configuration. We also link to tutorials for all of the skills required, so any interested party can easily acquire them.


Before testing a platform you build, make sure to complete the [Setup Instructions](https://github.com/fpt-corp/DiRa/tree/master/DiRa_Digital_Race_Software) and the [Platform Configuration Instructions - to be update soon](link).

### Components/DiRa_platform_parts_list

Spreadsheet of all parts required to build an DiRa Platform. The document includes the estimated price, quantities, and link to purchase each component. Parts are organized by vendor, and color coded by where on the platform they are used. The list includes the required parts, parts that help with usability (spare set of batteries), and some common maintenance items.

![alt text][note]  Review the entire list before making any purchases as you may already have some of the parts around such as computer monitors, spare laptops for use as ground station, assorted cables, keyboard and mouse, tools, and supplies.
